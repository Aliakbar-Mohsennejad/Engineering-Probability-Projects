## 📘 Engineering Probability Projects – K. N. Toosi University of Technology

This repository contains a series of educational mini-projects implemented in Python as part of the **Engineering Probability** course (Winter 2023), under the supervision of **Dr. Bahareh Akhbari**. These simulations were used to support student learning, and I contributed as a **TA (Teaching Assistant)** in designing and coding these exercises.

## ✅ Project List

### 🔹 Q1 – Galton Board Simulation

Simulates a Galton board using random left/right decisions to show how the **binomial distribution** approximates the **normal distribution**.

### 🔹 Q2 – Sum of Random Variables

Visualizes how the sum of i.i.d. random variables from **exponential** and **uniform** distributions evolves toward a **normal shape**, demonstrating the **Central Limit Theorem**.

### 🔹 Q3 – Bus Delay Simulation

Models a simple real-world scenario using a **uniform distribution** to simulate bus delays and calculate probabilities of waiting, with histogram analysis.
